About
=====

Krawler is a web crawler written in Kotlin. It is heavily inspired by the
Crawler4j (https://github.com/yasserg/crawler4j) by Yasser Ganjisaffar.
Major differences between Krawler and crawler4j are:

* Krawler differentiates between a "check" and a "visit". Checks are used to verify the status code of a resource by issuing an HTTP HEAD request rather than a GET request.
* Full redirect chain history is available when a page is visited, not just when determining if a page should be visited.
* Krawler collects full anchor tags including all attributes
* Krawler currently has no proxy support


Roadmap
=======

* Prevent re-crawling previously visited pages
* Proxy support
